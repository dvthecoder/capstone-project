# Capstone Project: Telecom Churn Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for my capstone project on Telecom Churn Prediction. The project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Project Highlights
- **Objective**: Predict and understand factors contributing to customer churn in a telecom company.
- **Tools and Technologies**: Alteryx, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Power BI and Power Query
- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle.com. It consists of 7043 records and 11 features, capturing various aspects of customer interactions and behaviors in the telecom industry. The dataset was preprocessed to ensure data quality and relevance for the churn prediction task.
  
## Project Structure
